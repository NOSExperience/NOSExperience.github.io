						<span style = "color: #444; font-weight: bold;">OUR&nbsp;<span style = "color: #000;">NEW MINECRAFT LAUNCHER</span></span>
						is a GLFW application that will eventually be a standalone custom launcher able to launch <span style = "font-style: italic;">Minecraft</span>
                        without any additional support. We hope for it to include a 3D block editor as well, but time will tell.
						<br><br>
                        We are investigating the use of OpenGL UI toolkits that will eventually form the interface of the editor and login. The code is already public,
                        and we hope you'll check it out. As of now, we aren't accepting PRs, but we would still love to hear your ideas and suggestions!

						<span style = "color: #444; font-weight: bold;">THE&nbsp;<span style = "color: #000;">NEW OPEN SERVER EXPERIENCE</span></span>
						is a rich, expansible, and enjoyable <span style = "font-style: italic;">Minecraft</span> experience currently in the works.<br>
						When <span style = "font-style: italic;">Minecraft</span> was released, it made waves in the game industry because of its open and dynamic gameplay nature.
						Combined with commercial success, the idea that the game is yours allowed <span style = "font-style: italic;">Minecraft</span> to excel past existing sandbox games
						with similar features. Everyone seemed interested in the idea that gameplay was <span style = "font-style: italic;">play</span>, dynamic, personal, and creative.
						<br><br>
						Several years down the line, the NOSE development team is working to take that customizability even further. We envision a game world where not only your use of the game's
						content is up to you, but also the game's content itself.
						<br><br>
						We are in the development stage, creating a declaritive XML specification to simplify adding blocks, items, and functionality to the game. 
						The system will download XML files from web servers, allowing each game server to define its own blocks and features.
						<br><br>
						Stay tuned to this site, we'll keep you posted.
