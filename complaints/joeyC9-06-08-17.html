            On 6/8/17 we recieved a complaint from Kaito47 that you have used illegal means for spawning in materials used for illegal combat.  We want to make it clear that you CANNOT combat a player without their consent.
            <br><br>
            We would like your feedback and are currently investigating this situation.  We will have a chat with you and Kaito47 on skype to workout this issue.
            <br><br>
            For the time being, you will be <i>Temporarily</i> <span style = "color: #444l; font-weight: bold;">BANNED</span> until further notice
            <br><br>
            Thank you for cooperating to make this server a fun and stable experience
